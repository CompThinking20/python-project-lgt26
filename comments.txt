So this is a great start to this project, and I think you're well on your way. Right now, the code itself doesn't yet output anything when run, which is fine for this phase of the project. I don't see any obvious errors—especially without actually running it—but I do wonder about the complexity of the faction and unit creation code: it seems to me that instead of creating separate functions for each of those, it might be easier and less error-prone to create a single function that is more flexible. However, since you already have the code, I'd recommend moving on to user input and see if you get the results you want. And that is the next step: see if you can give me something to interact with!

This is a lovely little game, and I think you've done an excellent job here. The thing I would ask you to work on is the ability of the user to enter garbage and have the game still run: you have it covered if I enter a number not in your list. But if I enter a string, the game crashes with an error. What's a pattern we've learned where you can, at the very least, give a more informative error message in that case?
